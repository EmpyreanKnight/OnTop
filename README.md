In this small Windows application, you can place arbitrary window always on the top of your screen with just one click.

# OS Compatability
Please note that this application can only be executed on Windows system since I used the Win32 API to manipulate window properties (although the GUI tool I used (PyQt5) is supposed to be cross-platform). Therefore, this application is **not** suitable for users using OSX or Unix or any OS other than Windows.

# On the Backstage
I originally designed this application only for myself when I wanted to watch animation while doing other works. I first tried to find and download a ready-made application to place the animation window on the top layer (while I'm using the online streaming, it is impossible to ask media player for help), only found ill-functioning or paid applications. Therefore, I decided to create a new one by myself.

# How to Use
After this application started up, just tick the box before the application title, then, enjoy it!

If you want to open a small window playing the animation at the corner of your screen just like me, I strongly recommend a Chrome extension [Separate Window](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/separate-window/cbgkkbaghihhnaeabfcmmglhnfkfnpon) to collaborate with my application. The Separate Window can create a new explorer page contains only the media player, then you can resize it and place the page at wherever you want!
